Tree builder for LeetCoders

This is a tree builder for leet coders.  
TreeBuilder builds a tree for you when leet code gives you a tree in a form of nullable integer array.  
For example:  
input: [6,3,5,null,2,0,null,null,1]  
output: The root tree node with the value 6.

###### How To Use  
1. Put the TreeNode.cs file in the folder where your other classes are
2. Update the name space in line#1 of TreeNode.cs
3. When you need to build a tree, just call the static method like TreeNode.BuildTree(input arr)
